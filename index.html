          <p class="typewriter">Hello, my name is Sai Charan, and I am currently a student of engineering. In my academic career,X
             I received a 10 CGPA in 10th grade and an 85% in intermediate. In addition to my academic responsibilities,
             I am an active member of the Department of Student Affairs (DSA), a college-level student organisation with 
             over 600 members. I oversee DSA's Social Media team of 54 people, and we have successfully 
             executed various social media campaigns and events.
            <br><br><br>
             Aside from my academic and extracurricular successes, I am passionate about learning new technologies
              and artistic endeavours such as editing and painting. I appreciate learning about new tools and applications, and
              I'm always up for new challenges and projects. In my spare time, I enjoy watching web series and engaging in hobbies.
             I hit the gym on a frequent schedule.
            <br><br><br>
            Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

              <p>A paragraph is a unit of writing that contains one main idea or topic. It is typically made up of a series of sentences that are related to each other and provide supporting details or examples for the main idea. The first sentence of a paragraph is often called the topic sentence, as it introduces the main idea that will be discussed in the following sentences. A well-written paragraph should be coherent and organized, with clear transitions between sentences and ideas.
